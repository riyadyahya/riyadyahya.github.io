# This is a CODEOWNERS file. It defines who is responsible for different parts of the codebase.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, they will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
